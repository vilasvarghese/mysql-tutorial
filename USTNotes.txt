Create a relational database with tables and 
	define 
		primary and 
		foreign keys 
			to establish relationships.
Perform basic SQL operations (
	SELECT, 
	INSERT, 
	UPDATE, 
	DELETE) 
		on the created tables.
Normalize a table structure to 
	eliminate redundancy and 
	apply proper indexes for performance.
Write a transaction 
	that adheres to 
		ACID properties and 
		ensure database integrity.
Design and implement a 
	backup and 
	recovery strategy for your database.
