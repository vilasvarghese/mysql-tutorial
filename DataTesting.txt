· Advanced  querying techniques for data validation and verification 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Profiling Queries:

	Use  queries to perform data profiling
			analyzing the structure, content, and quality of data in tables.
		Identify data distributions, patterns, and anomalies by querying column statistics such as distinct values, null counts, data ranges, and frequency distributions.
		Detect outliers, duplicates, missing values, and other data anomalies that may indicate data quality issues.
Data Consistency Checks:

	Write  queries to perform data consistency checks across multiple tables or datasets.
	Use joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions to compare data between related tables and ensure consistency in key fields or attributes.
	Verify referential integrity constraints such as foreign key relationships to ensure that child table records have corresponding parent table records.
Data Cleansing Queries:

	Develop  queries to clean and standardize data by correcting errors, removing duplicates, and resolving inconsistencies.
	Use string manipulation functions, regular expressions, and CASE statements to clean and normalize data values.
	Identify and handle data outliers or anomalies that may require manual intervention or special treatment.
Data Quality Metrics Queries:

	Define  queries to calculate data quality metrics such as completeness, accuracy, timeliness, and consistency.
	Measure data completeness by counting the percentage of missing values or nulls in key columns.
	Assess data accuracy by comparing data values against predefined validation rules or reference data sources.
	Evaluate data consistency by checking for discrepancies or variations in data values across different sources or time periods.
Error Logging and Reporting Queries:

	Create  queries to log and report data validation errors, exceptions, or discrepancies for further analysis and resolution.
	Use  INSERT statements to insert error records into a dedicated error log table, along with details such as error type, error message, affected rows, and timestamp.
	Generate summary reports or dashboards using  SELECT queries to visualize data quality metrics, error counts, and trends over time.
Automated Data Validation Queries:

	Implement automated  queries as part of data validation pipelines or ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to perform continuous data validation and verification.
	Schedule  queries to run at regular intervals or trigger them based on data arrival or update events.
	Use stored procedures or scripting languages (e.g., PL/, T-) to encapsulate complex validation logic and automate data quality checks.



--------------------
CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT (
    DEPT_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DEPT_NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

-- Create the EMPLOYEES table
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES (
    EMP_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EMP_NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    SALARY INT,
    DEPT_ID INT,
    CONSTRAINT FK_DEPT FOREIGN KEY (DEPT_ID) REFERENCES DEPARTMENT(DEPT_ID)
);


INSERT INTO DEPARTMENT (DEPT_ID, DEPT_NAME) VALUES
(1, 'Human Resources'),
(2, 'Finance'),
(3, 'Engineering'),
(4, 'Marketing');

INSERT INTO EMPLOYEES (EMP_ID, EMP_NAME, SALARY, DEPT_ID) VALUES
(101, 'John Doe', 60000, 1),
(102, 'Jane Smith', 75000, 2),
(103, 'Emily Davis', 85000, 3),
(104, 'Michael Brown', 70000, 4),
(105, 'Jessica Wilson', 95000, 3);



select * from employees;

select * from department;


Data Profiling Queries:
----------------------


-- Example: Calculate distinct values and null counts for each column in a table
	SELECT
		COLUMN_NAME,
		COUNT(DISTINCT COLUMN_NAME) AS DISTINCT_VALUES,
		COUNT(*) - COUNT(COLUMN_NAME) AS NULL_COUNT
	FROM
		YOUR_TABLE
	GROUP BY
		COLUMN_NAME;

	SELECT
		DEPT_ID,
		COUNT(DISTINCT DEPT_ID) AS DISTINCT_VALUES,
		COUNT(*) - COUNT(DEPT_ID) AS NULL_COUNT
	FROM
		EMPLOYEES
	GROUP BY
		DEPT_ID;



Data Consistency Checks:
----------------------



-- Example: Check for orphaned records in a child table (missing corresponding parent records)
SELECT
    CHILD_TABLE.*
FROM
    CHILD_TABLE
LEFT JOIN
    PARENT_TABLE ON CHILD_TABLE.PARENT_ID = PARENT_TABLE.ID
WHERE
    PARENT_TABLE.ID IS NULL;
		

SELECT
    EMPLOYEES.*
FROM
    EMPLOYEES
INNER JOIN
    DEPARTMENT ON EMPLOYEES.DEPT_ID = DEPARTMENT.DEPT_ID;


RIGHT JOIN EXAMPLE 
	INCLUDE DATA WHERE THERE ARE NO EMPLOYEES IN A DEPARTMENT 

INSERT INTO DEPARTMENT (DEPT_ID, DEPT_NAME) VALUES (5, 'Testing');

SELECT
    EMPLOYEES.emp_id,
	DEPARTMENT.dept_id
FROM
    EMPLOYEES
RIGHT JOIN
    DEPARTMENT ON EMPLOYEES.DEPT_ID = DEPARTMENT.DEPT_ID;
	

LEFT JOIN EXAMPLE 
	INCLUDE DATA WHERE EMPLOYEES DOESN'T BELOW TO ANY DEPARTMENT 
	
	
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEES (EMP_ID, EMP_NAME, SALARY, DEPT_ID) VALUES
(106, 'Vilas Varghese', 10000, null);	
	
	
SELECT
    EMPLOYEES.emp_id,
	DEPARTMENT.dept_id
FROM
    EMPLOYEES
LEFT JOIN
    DEPARTMENT ON EMPLOYEES.DEPT_ID = DEPARTMENT.DEPT_ID;	
	
Data Cleansing Queries:
----------------------

-- Example: Normalize phone number formats by removing non-numeric characters
UPDATE
    CUSTOMERS
SET
    PHONE_NUMBER = REGEXP_REPLACE(PHONE_NUMBER, '[^0-9]', '');

ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEES MODIFY SALARY VARCHAR(10);
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEES (EMP_ID, EMP_NAME, SALARY, DEPT_ID) VALUES (106, 'VILAS', '100USD', 3);
select REGEXP_REPLACE(SALARY, '[^0-9]', '') from EMPLOYEES;



Data Quality Metrics Queries:
--------------------------------------------


-- Example: Calculate completeness percentage for each column in a table


	
SELECT
    DEPT_ID,
    100.0 * COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEES) AS COMPLETENESS_PERCENTAGE
FROM
    EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY
    DEPT_ID;

	
	
	
	
Error Logging and Reporting Queries:
--------------------------------------------

-- Example: Insert error records into an error log table for missing values in a critical column
INSERT INTO
    ERROR_LOG (TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME, ERROR_TYPE, ERROR_MESSAGE, TIMESTAMP)
SELECT
    'YOUR_TABLE' AS TABLE_NAME,
    'CRITICAL_COLUMN' AS COLUMN_NAME,
    'MISSING_VALUE' AS ERROR_TYPE,
    'Null value detected in critical column' AS ERROR_MESSAGE,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS TIMESTAMP
FROM
    YOUR_TABLE
WHERE
    CRITICAL_COLUMN IS NULL;
	
Automated Data Validation Queries:


-- Example: Schedule a stored procedure to perform automated data validation checks
CREATE PROCEDURE PerformDataValidation
AS
BEGIN
    -- Data validation logic goes here
    -- For example: Execute data consistency checks, data profiling queries, etc.
END;

-- Schedule the stored procedure to run daily using  Server Agent or a similar scheduling tool
EXEC sp_procoption 'PerformDataValidation', 'STARTUP', 'ON';
These examples demonstrate how advanced  querying techniques can be applied to perform various data validation and verification tasks, including data profiling, consistency checks, cleansing, quality metrics calculation, error logging, and automated validation processes. Depending on the specific requirements and characteristics of your data, you can customize these queries to suit your needs and ensure the integrity and quality of your data assets.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
· Working with complex joins, subqueries, and window functions 
---------------------------------------------------------------------


Complex Joins:


CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY  auto_increment,
  customer_id INT NOT NULL,
  order_date DATE NOT NULL,
  order_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);

INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, customer_name)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe'),
       (2, 'Jane Smith'),
       (3, 'Alice Johnson');
	   
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date, order_amount)
VALUES (1, '2024-06-10', 100.00),
       (1, '2024-06-12', 50.00),
       (2, '2024-06-08', 200.50),
       (3, '2024-06-11', 75.25);	   



-- Example: Retrieve customer information along with their latest order details
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    o.order_amount
FROM
    customers c
INNER JOIN
    (
        SELECT
            customer_id,
            MAX(order_date) AS latest_order_date
        FROM
            orders
        GROUP BY
            customer_id
    ) latest_orders ON c.customer_id = latest_orders.customer_id
INNER JOIN
    orders o ON latest_orders.customer_id = o.customer_id AND latest_orders.latest_order_date = o.order_date;


OR 

SELECT customer_id, order_date
FROM (select * , 
    row_number() over(partition by customer_id order by order_date desc) as last_order_date from orders) a
where a.last_order_date = 1;


--ALREADY SEEN EXAMPLES LIKE THIS.

Subqueries:



-- Example: Find EMPLOYEESs who have a salary higher than the average salary in their department
SELECT
    EMPLOYEES_id,
    EMPLOYEES_name,
    department_id,
    salary
FROM
    EMPLOYEESs e
WHERE
    salary > (
        SELECT
            AVG(salary)
        FROM
            EMPLOYEESs
        WHERE
            department_id = e.department_id
    );
	

OR 


SELECT
    *
FROM
    EMPLOYEES e
WHERE
    salary > (
        SELECT
            AVG(salary)
        FROM
            EMPLOYEES E1 
      WHERE
            E1.depT_id = e.depT_id
    );
	
	
Window Functions:



-- Example: Calculate the running total of sales for each product using window functions
SELECT
    product_id,
    order_date,
    order_amount,
    SUM(order_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total
FROM
    sales;
These examples demonstrate how to work with complex  queries involving joins, subqueries, and window functions to perform various analytical tasks such as retrieving data from multiple tables, filtering data based on subquery results, and calculating aggregated values using window functions. By mastering these advanced  techniques, you can efficiently analyze and manipulate data to derive valuable insights for decision-making and reporting purposes.


window function 
---------------
	type of function 
		performs a calculation across a set of rows 
			related to the current row 
				within a query result set. 
	Unlike 
		regular aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT)
			which operate on an entire result set
		window functions operate on a subset of rows defined by a "window" or "partition" of data.

Key characteristics of window functions include:

	Partitioning: 
		The data is divided into 
			partitions or groups 
				based on specified criteria, 
			such as columns or expressions. 
	Each partition is processed separately by the window function.

	Ordering: 
		Within each partition, 
			the rows are ordered according to a specified order. 
			The order determines the sequence in which rows are processed by the window function.

	Frame Specification: 
		Optionally, a window function can define a frame, which further narrows down the subset of rows within each partition that the function operates on. The frame is defined by specifying a start and end point relative to the current row.



A window function in SQL 
	type of function 
	calculates across a set of rows 
		related to the current row 
			within a query result set. 
	N.B:  
		regular aggregate functions 
			(e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT), 
			operate on an entire result set
	window functions operate on a subset of rows 
		defined by a "window" or "partition" of data.

Key characteristics of window functions include:

	Partitioning: 
		data 
			divided into partitions 
			or groups based on specified criteria
				such as columns or expressions. 
		Each partition 
			processed separately by the window function.

	Ordering: 
		Within each partition
			rows are ordered according to a specified order. 
		The order determines the sequence in which rows are processed by the window function.

	Frame Specification: 
		Optionally
			window function 
			can define a frame
			further narrows down the subset of rows 
				within each partition that the function operates on. 
		The frame is defined 
			by specifying a start and end point 
				relative to the current row.

Commonly used window functions include:

	ROW_NUMBER(): 
		Assigns a unique sequential integer 
			to each row within a partition
			based on the specified ordering.
	RANK() and DENSE_RANK(): 
		Assigns a ranking 
			to each row within a partition, 
			with ties optionally handled differently.
	LEAD() and LAG(): 
		Accesses data from rows 
			at a specified offset 
			relative to the current row 
			within the partition.
	SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX(): 
		Computes aggregate functions over a window of rows within each partition.





-----------------------
		Differences Between ROW_NUMBER() and RANK()
		-------------------------------------------
		
			Unique Identifier vs. Rank:
				ROW_NUMBER() 
					assigns a unique number 
						to each row in the ordered partition, 
					ensuring no duplicates.
				RANK() 
					assigns the same rank to rows with equal values in the ordering criteria, and the ranks may have gaps.

			Handling of Ties:
				ROW_NUMBER() does not handle ties; each row gets a unique sequential number.
				RANK() gives the same rank to tied rows, causing gaps in the ranking sequence.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ROW_NUMBER() function 
	assigns a unique sequential integer 
		to rows within a partition of the result set
		start at 1 for the first row in each partition.

		Syntax:


		ROW_NUMBER() OVER ([PARTITION BY partition_expression] ORDER BY sort_expression)

			PARTITION BY: 
				(Optional) Divides the result set 
					into partitions 
					ROW_NUMBER() function is applied. 
				If no partition specified
					function treats the entire result set as a single partition.
			ORDER BY: 
				Specifies the order of the rows within each partition.

		Example:

		SELECT 
			column1, 
			column2, 
			ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY column1) AS row_num
		FROM 
			table_name;


RANK()

		The RANK() function 
			assigns a rank to each row 
				within a partition of the result set. 
			Rows with the same values 
				in the order by clause 
					receive the same rank
				next rank is not consecutive. 
			It skips rank values to maintain the same relative rank for tied rows.

		Syntax:

		RANK() OVER ([PARTITION BY partition_expression] ORDER BY sort_expression)

			PARTITION BY: 
				(Optional) Divides the result set 
					into partitions 
					RANK() function is applied. 
			If not specified
				the function treats the entire result set as a single partition.
		ORDER BY: 
			Specifies the order of the rows within each partition.

		Example:

		SELECT 
			column1, 
			column2, 
			RANK() OVER (ORDER BY column1) AS rank
		FROM 
			table_name;
.

CREATE TABLE employees (
		employee_id INT,
		name VARCHAR,
		SALARY INTEGER(10)
	);
		
		Example Illustrating the Difference:
		-----------------------------------
		
		Assume we have the following table employees:
		employee_id	name	salary
		1	Alice			5000
		2	Bob				6000
		3	Charlie			6000
		4	David			4000

		Using ROW_NUMBER():


		SELECT 
			name, 
			salary, 
			ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num
		FROM 
			employees;

		Result:
		name	salary	row_num
		Bob		6000	1
		Charlie	6000	2
		Alice	5000	3
		David	4000	4

		Using RANK():

		SELECT 
			name, 
			salary, 
			RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
		FROM 
			employees;

			Result:
		name	salary	rank
		Bob		6000	1
		Charlie	6000	1
		Alice	5000	3
		David	4000	4

		In the RANK() example, 
			both Bob and Charlie 
				receive the same rank of 1
			next rank is 3, 
			skipping 2. 
		In contrast, ROW_NUMBER() assigns a unique number to each row.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------				
	NTILE(): 
		Divide data into equal-sized groups. 
			analyze data distribution and 
			identify potential outliers or 
			inconsistencies.

	NTILE function in MySQL 
		window function 
		divides rows in a result set 
			into a specified number of approximately equal groups, or "tiles". 
		assigns each row a number 
			representing the tile to which the row belongs. 
		advantage
		---------
			distribute rows into different groups 
				for further analysis or processing.

	Syntax

	NTILE(n) OVER ([PARTITION BY partition_expression] ORDER BY sort_expression)

		n: 
			The number of tiles (groups) to divide the result set into.
		PARTITION BY: 
			(Optional) Divides the result set into partitions to which the NTILE function is applied. 
			If not specified, the function treats the entire result set as a single partition.
		ORDER BY: 
			Specifies the order of the rows within each partition. The NTILE function assigns tile numbers based on this order.


		Consider the following table employees:
		employee_id	name	salary
		1			Alice	5000
		2			Bob		6000
		3			Charlie	4000
		4			David	4500
		5			Eve		7000
		6			Frank	5500

		Using NTILE to Divide into 2 Tiles

		sql

		SELECT 
			name, 
			salary, 
			NTILE(2) OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS tile
		FROM 
			employees;
			
			
		SELECT #(create table and insert commands below)
			*, 
			NTILE(2) OVER (ORDER BY sale_amount DESC) AS tile
		FROM 
			sales;	

		Result:
		name	salary	tile
		Eve		7000	1
		Bob		6000	1
		Frank	5500	1
		Alice	5000	2
		David	4500	2
		Charlie	4000	2

		In this example, 
			NTILE(2) function 
				divides the rows into two tiles 
					based on the salary in descending order. 
			The first three rows fall into tile 1
				remaining rows fall into tile 2.

		Using NTILE to Divide into 3 Tiles


		SELECT 
			name, 
			salary, 
			NTILE(3) OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS tile
		FROM 
			employees;

		Result:
		name	salary	tile
		Eve		7000	1
		Bob		6000	1
		Frank	5500	2
		Alice	5000	2
		David	4500	3
		Charlie	4000	3

		In this example, the NTILE(3) function divides the rows into three tiles. The first two rows fall into tile 1, the next two into tile 2, and the last two into tile 3.
		Practical Use Cases

			Performance Analysis:
				You can divide employees into performance groups based on their scores or ratings.

			Salary Distribution:
				Group employees into different salary bands to analyze salary distribution.

			Sales Analysis:
				Divide sales data into quantiles to analyze the distribution of sales figures.


DENSE_RANK
----------

Summary of Differences
	RANK() 
		leaves gaps in the ranking sequence 
			when there are ties. 
			For example, 
				after two entries ranked at 2, the next rank is 4.
	DENSE_RANK() 
		does not leave gaps in the ranking sequence 
			when there are ties. 
		For example
			after two entries ranked at 2, 
				the next rank is 3.

	differences between RANK() and DENSE_RANK() with an example. 
		We'll use a hypothetical table named sales to demonstrate how these functions work.

	Example Table Structure


	CREATE TABLE sales (
		sale_id INT,
		employee_id INT,
		sale_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
	);

	INSERT INTO sales (sale_id, employee_id, sale_amount) VALUES
	(1, 1, 100.00),
	(2, 2, 200.00),
	(3, 3, 300.00),
	(4, 4, 200.00),
	(5, 5, 300.00),
	(6, 6, 400.00);
	Using RANK()

	The RANK() function assigns ranks with gaps if there are ties.

	SELECT 
		employee_id,
		sale_amount,
		RANK() OVER (ORDER BY sale_amount DESC) 
	FROM 
		sales;
	Output
	employee_id	sale_amount	rank
	6	400.00	1
	3	300.00	2
	5	300.00	2
	2	200.00	4
	4	200.00	4
	1	100.00	6
	Using DENSE_RANK()
	The DENSE_RANK() function assigns consecutive ranks without gaps for ties.


	SELECT 
		employee_id,
		sale_amount,
		DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY sale_amount DESC) AS dense_rank
	FROM 
		sales;
	Output
	employee_id	sale_amount	dense_rank
	6	400.00	1
	3	300.00	2
	5	300.00	2
	2	200.00	3
	4	200.00	3
	1	100.00	4


-----------------------------------


LEAD() and LAG() 
----------------
	window functions in SQL 
	access data from 
		subsequent 
	or 
		preceding rows
			respectively, without the need for self-joins. 
	useful for comparing values in a time series or ordered set of data.

	Definitions
		LEAD(): 
			Accesses data from a subsequent row.
		LAG(): 
			Accesses data from a preceding row.

	Example Table Structure

	CREATE TABLE sales (
		sale_id INT,
		employee_id INT,
		sale_date DATE,
		sale_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
	);

	INSERT INTO sales (sale_id, employee_id, sale_date, sale_amount) VALUES
	(1, 1, '2023-01-01', 100.00),
	(2, 2, '2023-01-02', 200.00),
	(3, 3, '2023-01-03', 300.00),
	(4, 4, '2023-01-04', 150.00),
	(5, 5, '2023-01-05', 250.00),
	(6, 6, '2023-01-06', 350.00);

	Using LAG()
	-------------
	The LAG() function accesses data from a preceding row. 
	This can be used to compare a row with its previous row.

	SELECT 
		sale_id,
		employee_id,
		sale_date,
		sale_amount,
		LAG(sale_amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS prev_sale_amount
	FROM 
		sales;
		
		
	SELECT 
		sale_id,
		employee_id,
		sale_amount,
		LAG(sale_amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY employee_id) AS prev_sale_amount
	FROM 
		sales;	
	Output
	
	sale_id	employee_id		sale_date		sale_amount		prev_sale_amount
	1		1				2023-01-01		100.00			NULL
	2		2				2023-01-02		200.00			100.00
	3		3				2023-01-03		300.00			200.00
	4		4				2023-01-04		150.00			300.00
	5		5				2023-01-05		250.00			150.00
	6		6				2023-01-06		350.00			250.00
	
	Using LEAD()
	------------
	The LEAD() function accesses data from a subsequent row. 
	This can be used to compare a row with its next row.

	SELECT 
		sale_id,
		employee_id,
		sale_date,
		sale_amount,
		LEAD(sale_amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS next_sale_amount
	FROM 
		sales;
		
	SELECT 
		sale_id,
		employee_id,
		sale_amount,
		LEAD(sale_amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY employee_id) AS next_sale_amount
	FROM 
		sales;	
	Output
	sale_id		employee_id		sale_date		sale	_amount		next_sale_amount
	1			1				2023-01-01		100.00			200.00
	2			2				2023-01-02		200.00			300.00
	3			3				2023-01-03		300.00			150.00
	4			4				2023-01-04		150.00			250.00
	5			5				2023-01-05		250.00			350.00
	6			6				2023-01-06		350.00			NULL
	
	Practical Differences
	LAG():

		Used to compare the current row with the previous row.
		Useful for calculating differences or changes over time (e.g., day-to-day sales changes).
	LEAD():

		Used to compare the current row with the next row.
		Useful for predicting future values or looking ahead (e.g., projecting sales).
	Example Use Cases
		Use Case: Day-to-Day Sales Change

		Using LAG() to calculate the change in sales amount compared to the previous day.



	SELECT 
		sale_date,
		sale_amount,
		sale_amount - LAG(sale_amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS daily_change
	FROM 
		sales;
	
	Use Case: Future Sales Projection
	Using LEAD() to project the sales amount for the next day.



	SELECT 
		sale_date,
		sale_amount,
		LEAD(sale_amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS next_day_projection
	FROM 
		sales;

· Optimization techniques for improving  query performance. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Indexes:

	Indexes 
		significantly improve query performance 
			database to quickly locate rows based on the indexed columns.
	Identify columns frequently used in 
		WHERE clauses, 
		JOIN conditions, or 
		ORDER BY clauses, and 
	create appropriate indexes on those columns.
	
	Be cautious 
		not to over-index
		it can impact 
			insert/update/delete performance 
		increase storage requirements.
Optimize Query Structure:

	Simplify complex queries 
		by breaking them down into smaller, 
		more manageable parts.
	Use appropriate JOIN types 
		(INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) 
			based on the relationship between tables.
	Avoid using SELECT * 
		retrieve only the necessary columns to 
			reduce data transfer overhead.
Avoid Subqueries and Correlated Subqueries:

	Subqueries can often be rewritten as JOINs 
	or 
	transformed into derived tables to improve performance.
	Correlated subqueries can be particularly inefficient 
		as they execute 
			once for each row processed by the outer query. 
	Consider alternatives like JOINs or window functions.

Use WHERE Clause Wisely:

	Use WHERE clause 
		to filter rows early 
		in the query execution process.
	Avoid using functions or expressions 
		in the WHERE clause 
			on indexed columns
		will prevent the database from utilizing indexes.
	
	Use 
		EXISTS or 
		IN clauses 
		
		instead of 
			DISTINCT or 
			GROUP BY for filtering.
Optimize Joins:

	Use appropriate join algorithms 
		(e.g., 
			nested loop join, 
			hash join, 
			merge join) 
				based on the size of the tables, available indexes, and query conditions.
	
	
	Avoid Cartesian joins by ensuring proper join conditions are specified.
	---------------------
	Consider denormalizing data or using materialized views for frequently accessed data that involves complex joins.
Use Stored Procedures and Prepared Statements:

	Stored procedures 
		reduce network overhead 
		improve query execution speed 
			by pre-compiling statements.
	Prepared statements 
		can be cached by the database server
		faster execution 
			when the same query is reused with different parameters.
Monitor and Analyze Query Performance:

	Use 
		database profiling and 
		monitoring tools 
			to identify slow-performing queries.
	Analyze query execution plans 
		to understand how the database engine is processing the query and 
		identify potential bottlenecks.
	Use 
		database system statistics and 
		diagnostic views 
			to identify areas for optimization
			like inefficient index usage or excessive disk I/O.
Optimize Disk I/O:

	Minimize disk I/O by 
		properly sizing database buffers and caches.
	Consider partitioning large tables 
		to improve disk I/O performance and 
		facilitate parallel query execution.
	applying optimization techniques
		significantly improve performance of your  queries
		lead to faster response times
		reduce resource utilization
		improved overall system efficiency.

· Writing  scripts for automated data testing processes 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Completeness Check:

	Verify that all required fields in a table contain non-null values.


		-- Example: Check if all rows in the 'customers' table have non-null values in the 'customer_name' column
		SELECT COUNT(*)
		FROM customers
		WHERE customer_name IS NULL;

Data Consistency Check:

	Validate that data in related tables maintains referential integrity.


		-- Example: Check if all order records in the 'orders' table have corresponding customer records in the 'customers' table
		SELECT COUNT(*)
		FROM orders o
		LEFT JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
		WHERE c.customer_id IS NULL;

Data Accuracy Check:

	Compare data in a table against predefined rules or thresholds to ensure accuracy.


	-- Example: Check if order amounts in the 'orders' table are within a specified range
	SELECT COUNT(*)
	FROM orders
	WHERE order_amount < 0 OR order_amount > 1000;

Data Consistency Check Across Tables:

	Validate that data in multiple tables remains consistent.


	-- Example: Check if the total order amount in the 'orders' table matches the sum of order amounts in the 'order_items' table
	SELECT 
		(SELECT SUM(order_amount) FROM orders) AS total_order_amount,
		(SELECT SUM(order_amount) FROM order_items) AS total_order_items_amount;

Data Quality Metrics Calculation:

	Calculate data quality metrics to assess the overall quality of the data.


	-- Example: Calculate the percentage of null values in the 'customer_email' column of the 'customers' table
	SELECT 
		(COUNT(*) - COUNT(customer_email)) / COUNT(*) * 100 AS null_percentage
	FROM customers;

Data Consistency Check Over Time:

	Validate that data remains consistent over time, such as comparing current data with historical data.


	-- Example: Check if the number of active customers has increased compared to the previous month
	SELECT 
		COUNT(*) AS current_active_customers
	FROM customers
	WHERE registration_date >= DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE());
	
	DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE())
		reduce 1 month from today.
	
	DATEADD(date_part, number, date)
		date_part: 
			part of the date to be added or subtracted 
				(e.g., 
					DAY	=> add/reduce days
					MONTH	=> add/reduce months
					YEAR => add/reduce years).
		number: 
			number of date parts to add or subtract 
				(a (+) number adds and 
					(-) number subtracts).
		date: The starting date.

These  scripts serve as examples of automated data testing processes and can be integrated into testing frameworks or automation pipelines to ensure the quality and reliability of data. By regularly executing these scripts, organizations can identify data issues early and prevent data integrity problems in production environments.

	Transform, 
	Load) 
ETL	testing 
	involves 
		validating the entire ETL process 
		ensure data is extracted from 
			source systems, 
			transformed according to business rules
		loaded into the target data warehouse 
		or 
		database accurately and efficiently. 
	Automation 
		critical in ETL testing

	Here's what can be done:

	Test Case Design:

		Identify and document test scenarios
			including 
				data extraction
				transformation rules
				data loading
				error handling, and 
				data reconciliation.
		Design test cases 
			covering both 
				functional and non-functional requirements
				such as 
					data completeness, 
					accuracy, 
					consistency, and 
					performance.

	Automated Test Scripts:

			techniques to 
				simulate 
					realistic scenarios and 
					edge cases.
		Ensure that 
			test data covers various 
				data types, 
				formats, and 
				volumes 
					to validate the 
						robustness and 
						scalability 
							of the ETL process.
	Regression Testing:

			data loading, and 
			error messages 
				to facilitate troubleshooting and root cause analysis.
	Example ETL Testing Automation Script (Using SQL):

	-- Example: Automated ETL testing script to verify data completeness and accuracy after data loading
		-- Step 1: Extract data from source table
		CREATE TABLE #extracted_data AS
		SELECT * FROM source_table;

		-- Step 2: Transform data (apply business rules)
		CREATE TABLE #transformed_data AS
		SELECT 
			customer_id,
			UPPER(customer_name) AS customer_name_upper,
			CASE 
				WHEN order_amount > 1000 THEN 'High'
				WHEN order_amount > 500 THEN 'Medium'
				ELSE 'Low'
			END AS order_priority
		FROM #extracted_data;

		-- Step 3: Load transformed data into target table
		INSERT INTO target_table
		SELECT * FROM #transformed_data;


		-- Step 4: Verify data completeness and accuracy
		-- Check if all records from source table are loaded into target table
		SELECT COUNT(*) AS source_records, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM target_table) AS target_records
		FROM source_table;

		-- Check if transformed data meets business rules
		SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records,
			   SUM(CASE WHEN customer_name_upper IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_customer_names,
			   SUM(CASE WHEN order_priority NOT IN ('High', 'Medium', 'Low') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS invalid_order_priorities
		FROM #transformed_data;

		-- Step 5: Clean up temporary tables
		DROP TABLE #extracted_data;
		DROP TABLE #transformed_data;

This example SQL script demonstrates how to automate ETL testing by extracting data from a source table, transforming it according to business rules, loading it into a target table, and verifying data completeness and accuracy. Automated ETL testing scripts like this can be scheduled to run regularly as part of the testing process to ensure the reliability and integrity of the ETL pipeline.

	Data profiling involves 
		analyzing source and target data 
			to understand its 
				structure, 
				quality, and 
				distribution.
	Example: 
		Analyze the distribution of values 
			in a source column 
				to identify 
					outliers, 
					missing values, or 
					data anomalies 
						that may impact the ETL process.

Metadata Testing:

	Test metadata components like 
		source-to-target mappings, 
		transformations, and 
		business rules 
			to ensure consistency and accuracy.
	Example: 
		Validate that 
			mapping document 
				accurately reflects the 
					transformation logic 
						implemented in the ETL processes.

Incremental Load Testing:

	Test incremental data loading processes 
		to ensure that 
			only 
				new or changed data is extracted and 
				loaded into the target system.
	Example: 
		Verify that the ETL process 
			correctly identifies and loads 
				only the records that have been modified 
					since the last extraction run.

Data Quality Testing:

	Test data quality dimensions such as 
		completeness, 
		accuracy, 
		consistency, and 
		integrity 
			across the ETL pipeline.
	Example:

			validation rules 
				applied during the transformation phase 
					produce the expected results and 
					improve data quality.

Regression Testing:

	Perform regression testing 
		to ensure 
			changes to 
				ETL processes 
			or 
				source/target systems 
					do not introduce 
						unintended side effects or 
						data discrepancies.

		Re-run 
			previously executed test cases 
				after making changes to 
					ETL mappings or 
					transformations 
						to verify that 
							existing functionality still works as expected.

Performance Testing:

	Test the performance of ETL processes 
		under various conditions, 
			such as 
				different data volumes, 
				network latency, or 
				hardware configurations.
	Example:

			extract, 
			transform, and 
			load 
				a large dataset and 
		compare it Vs predefined performance benchmarks.

Error Handling and Logging Testing:

	Test 
		error handling mechanisms 
		logging functionality 
			to ensure that ETL processes 
				can recover gracefully 
				from errors and 
				provide sufficient logging for troubleshooting.
	Example: 
		Intentionally introduce errors 
			into source data and 
			verify that 
				ETL process logs the errors
				retries failed records, and 
				continues processing without data loss.

Data Lineage and Impact Analysis:

	Test data lineage and 
	impact analysis capabilities 
		to trace data 
			from source 
			to target 
		understand the impact of changes on downstream systems.
	Example: 
		Trace the flow of data through the ETL pipeline 
		identify all downstream systems and 
		reports that rely on the transformed data.

· Performance tuning and optimization of ETL processes for efficiency and scalability 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Understanding SQL Performance Bottlenecks
-----------------------------------------
Before optimizing, 
	identify what's slowing down your queries. 
	
Common culprits:

	Missing or Inefficient Indexes: 
		Indexes speed up data retrieval but can slow down inserts/updates.
	Poorly Written Queries: 
		Inefficient joins, subqueries, or unnecessary calculations can be costly.
	Lack of Statistics: 
		Databases need accurate statistics to create optimal query plans.
	Hardware Limitations: 
		Insufficient memory, disk speed, or CPU power can be a limiting factor.

Performance Tuning Techniques

Index Optimization
Create Indexes: Add indexes to columns frequently used in WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clauses.


-- Create an index on the "last_name" column
	CREATE INDEX idx_customers_last_name ON customers (last_name);


Analyze Query Plans: 
	Use EXPLAIN or similar tools 
		how your database executes queries and identify missing indexes.
Query Optimization
	SELECT Only What You Need: 
		Avoid SELECT * and fetch only the necessary columns.

Efficient Joins: 
	Use appropriate JOIN types 
		(INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) 
	prioritize smaller tables on the left side of joins.
Limit Result Sets: 
	Use LIMIT to restrict the number of rows returned
	[especially during development].
Rewrite Subqueries: 
	joins are better Subqueries 
		but confirm.


-- Inefficient subquery
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id IN 
	(SELECT id FROM customers WHERE last_name = 'Smith');


-- Optimized join
SELECT 
	o.* 	#better o.column_name
FROM 
	orders o
JOIN 
	customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
WHERE 
	c.last_name = 'Smith';


Statistics Management

set statistics io,time, on 

Update Statistics Regularly: 
	Outdated statistics lead to poor query plans. 
	Use tools like ANALYZE or UPDATE STATISTICS to keep them fresh.
SQL
-- Update statistics for the "customers" table
ANALYZE customers;


Example: Putting it All Together

Table Creation and Sample Data

SQL
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Insert some sample data (you can add more)
INSERT INTO customers VALUES 
    (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com'),
    (2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com'),
    (3, 'Alice', 'Johnson', 'alice.johnson@example.com');

INSERT INTO orders VALUES
    (101, 1, '2024-01-15', 150.50),
    (102, 2, '2024-02-20', 85.25),
    (103, 1, '2024-03-10', 220.00);


Optimized Query

Let's find all orders placed by customers with the last name 'Doe' in a performant way:

SQL
-- Assuming an index on customers(last_name)
SELECT 
	o.*
FROM 
	orders o
JOIN 
	customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
WHERE 
	c.last_name = 'Doe';


Key Considerations

Caching: 
	Utilize caching mechanisms 
		to store frequently accessed results and 
		reduce database load.
Batching: 
	For bulk operations 
		(inserts, updates), 
	use batching to minimize round trips to the database.
Profiling: 
	Profile your application 
		to pinpoint specific SQL queries 
			that are causing bottlenecks.
Denormalization: 
	In some cases, 
		denormalizing your data (adding redundant data) 
			can improve read performance 
			at the cost of increased write complexity.

	e.g. 
		SQL bulk insert statements 
		or 
		database-specific bulk loading utilities
			to minimize overhead and improve performance.
	Utilize 
		partitioning and 
		indexing strategies 
			to optimize data loading into target tables
				especially for large datasets.
Scale Infrastructure:

	Scale hardware resources
	like 
		CPU
		memory, and 
		storage
			to handle increased data volumes and processing demands.
	Consider
		deploying ETL processes on 
			distributed or 
			cloud-based infrastructure 
				to leverage scalability and elasticity benefits.
Use Efficient Data Formats:

	Utilize efficient data formats like Parquet, ORC, or Avro for storing intermediate and final data sets, as these formats offer compression and optimization benefits, reducing storage requirements and improving query performance.
	Consider using columnar storage for analytics workloads to optimize query performance for analytical queries.
Implement Caching and Memoization:

	Cache frequently accessed data and computation results to reduce redundant processing and improve response times.
	Implement memoization techniques to store the results of expensive computations and reuse them when the same input parameters are encountered again.
Monitor and Tune Regularly:

	Continuously monitor ETL process performance and resource utilization using monitoring tools and performance metrics.
	Regularly review and tune the ETL process based on changing data volumes, usage patterns, and business requirements to ensure ongoing optimization and scalability.
Automate Optimization Tasks:

	Implement automation scripts and tools to automate performance tuning tasks, such as index optimization, query profiling, and resource allocation adjustments, based on predefined thresholds and policies.
	By implementing these performance tuning and optimization strategies, organizations can improve the efficiency, scalability, and reliability of their ETL processes, enabling faster data integration and better decision-making capabilities.

--------------------

ETL processes deal with large amounts of data, and ensuring smooth and efficient operation is crucial. Here are various performance tuning and optimization techniques you can employ during ETL:

Data Extraction Optimization:

	Identify and Extract Only Relevant Data: 
		Don't pull everything from the source. Analyze your needs and extract only the required data sets for transformation and loading. This reduces network bandwidth usage, processing power needed, and storage requirements.
	
	Parallelize Extraction (if applicable): 
		If your ETL tool allows, explore parallel extraction. This involves extracting data from multiple source tables or files simultaneously, potentially speeding up the process.

	Data Transformation Optimization:

		Optimize Transformation Logic: 
			Review your transformation logic for redundancies or inefficiencies. Use efficient coding techniques and built-in functions within your ETL tool whenever possible.
		Caching Frequently Used Data: 
			If specific lookup tables or reference data are used repeatedly, consider caching them in memory. This reduces the need for repetitive database lookups, improving performance.

Data Types:
Ensure that the data types of the received values match the expected types (e.g., string, integer, etc.).
Regular Expressions:
Use regular expressions to validate specific data patterns within the response.
Data Comparison:
Compare entire data structures or arrays with expected values using deep comparison methods.
4. Best Practices:

Document Expected Responses:
Clearly define the expected status codes and data structure for each API endpoint.

Key Components of Compliance Testing:

Compliance testing typically involves the following key components:
Risk Assessment: Identifying and assessing risks associated with non-compliance and regulatory violations.
Control Evaluation: Evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of controls implemented to address compliance requirements.
Testing Procedures: Conducting testing procedures, such as walkthroughs, document reviews, interviews, and testing of controls, to validate compliance with regulatory requirements.
Remediation and Follow-Up: Addressing identified deficiencies through remediation activities and implementing corrective actions to improve compliance posture.
Testing Methodologies:

Compliance testing may utilize various testing methodologies, including:
Document Review: Reviewing policies, procedures, contracts, and other documentation to ensure alignment with regulatory requirements.
Control Testing: Testing the effectiveness of controls through walkthroughs, observations, and substantive testing procedures.
Data Analysis: Analyzing data and transactions to identify anomalies, discrepancies, or violations of compliance requirements.
Interviewing: Conducting interviews with key personnel to gather information and assess awareness of compliance obligations.
Reporting and Documentation:

Compliance testing results are documented and communicated through formal reports, findings memoranda, or compliance attestations.
Reports typically include an executive summary, detailed findings, recommendations for improvement, and management responses.
Documentation provides evidence of compliance efforts and serves as a basis for regulatory filings, audits, and external assessments.
Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:

Compliance testing is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring of regulatory changes, industry developments, and internal control effectiveness.
Organizations should establish mechanisms for ongoing monitoring, review, and enhancement of compliance programs to adapt to evolving regulatory requirements and mitigate emerging risks.
In summary, compliance testing is essential for ensuring that organizations adhere to regulatory requirements and industry standards, mitigate compliance risks, and demonstrate commitment to ethical business practices and legal obligations. By conducting thorough compliance testing and addressing identified deficiencies, organizations can strengthen their compliance posture and build trust with stakeholders.
